@title Yearn Vault Factory
@license GNU AGPLv3
@author yearn.finance
@notice
    This vault Factory can be used by anyone wishing to deploy their own
    ERC4626 compliant Yearn V3 Vault of the same API version.

    The factory clones new vaults from its specific `VAULT_ORIGINAL`
    immutable address set on creation of the factory.
    
    The deployments are done through create2 with a specific `salt` 
    that is derived from a combination of the deployer's address,
    the underlying asset used, as well as the name and symbol specified.
    Meaning a deployer will not be able to deploy the exact same vault
    twice and will need to use different name and or symbols for vaults
    that use the same other parameters such as `asset`.

    The factory also holds the protocol fee configs for each vault and strategy
    of its specific `API_VERSION` that determine how much of the fees
    charged are designated "protocol fees" and sent to the designated
    `fee_recipient`. The protocol fees work through a revenue share system,
    where if the vault or strategy decides to charge X amount of total
    fees during a `report` the protocol fees are a percent of X.
    The protocol fees will be sent to the designated fee_recipient and
    then (X - protocol_fees) will be sent to the vault/strategy specific
    fee recipient.
