@notice
    The Yearn VaultV3 is designed as a non-opinionated system to distribute funds of 
    depositors for a specific `asset` into different opportunities (aka Strategies)
    and manage accounting in a robust way.

    Depositors receive shares (aka vaults tokens) proportional to their deposit amount. 
    Vault tokens are yield-bearing and can be redeemed at any time to get back deposit 
    plus any yield generated.

    Addresses that are given different permissioned roles by the `role_manager` 
    are then able to allocate funds as they best see fit to different strategies 
    and adjust the strategies and allocations as needed, as well as reporting realized
    profits or losses.

    Strategies are any ERC-4626 compliant contracts that use the same underlying `asset` 
    as the vault. The vault provides no assurances as to the safety of any strategy
    and it is the responsibility of those that hold the corresponding roles to choose
    and fund strategies that best fit their desired specifications.

    Those holding vault tokens are able to redeem the tokens for the corresponding
    amount of underlying asset based on any reported profits or losses since their
    initial deposit.

    The vault is built to be customized by the management to be able to fit their
    specific desired needs. Including the customization of strategies, accountants, 
    ownership etc.
